# ChessLib
## Overview

ChessLib is a standard chess game implementation library. To test it out you can run chessgame which is a console-based game running on ChessLib. Note that for now it only supports human players.

The thought process behind this project was for me to implement a chess engine for the first time, without seeing
code from other projects or how implementations of chess engines are generally done.

## How to play

You type the uppercase letter of the piece you want 
to move as you see it on the board and the coordinates of the square you want to move to 
(for example if you want to move Pawn to square A3 you type Pa3), and the game will find the piece you want to move
and move it by itself.

The game ends if the king has no moves to make, but it won't prevent you from moving the King to a square that will threaten him,
so it can end after the other player directly captures the King.

A log file that records all the moves that took place, is created during the game.

With the Linux version if you type 'pieces' you will get the Unicode chess characters and if you type 'letters' it reverts back.

## Building

Needs libncurses to compile on Linux.

If you're compiling on Windows, try using Mingw-w64 to install gcc and dmake (or make). It will probably won't compile as well with MSVC.

To compile and run on Windows with dmake (or make):

    dmake dll & dmake exe & chessgame.exe
    
or if you're using Powershell:

    dmake dll;dmake exe;./chessgame.exe

To compile and run on Linux:

    make && make run

I will be releasing precompiled binaries made on Ubuntu 14.04 i386 
and Windows 7 32bit, when bugs are fixed or something in the UI changes.

## TODO

* add functionality for the engine to detect checkmate and end the game (WIP)

* fix this weird bug that only happens with black Pawns (DONE)

* prevent the King from moving to a square that might threaten him (WIP)

* program a computer(AI) player (WIP)

* make a test GUI chess game using ChessLib

* move to other files all the command line specific functions (such as printBoard) and rewrite the Makefile

* port the main engine to other languages
