# Sample chess game
## Overview

The game is self-explanatory, but basically it's a very simple chess game for two players.

No AI implemented yet. You type the uppercase letter of the piece you want 
to move as you see it on the board and the coordinates of the square you want to move to 
(for example if you want to move Pawn to square A3 you type Pa3), and the game will find the piece you want to move
and move it by itself.

The game ends if the king has no moves to make, but it won't prevent you from moving the King to a square that will threaten him,
so it can end after the other player directly kills the King.

A log file that records all the moves that took place, is created during the game.

With the Linux version if you type 'pieces' you will get the Unicode chess characters and if you type 'letters' it reverts back.

The thought process behind this project was for me to implement a chess engine for the first time, without seeing
code from other projects or how implementations of chess engines are generally done.

## Prerequisites

Needs libncurses to compile. (on Linux)

If you're compiling on Windows, try using Mingw-w64 to install gcc. I don't think it will compile as well with MSVC.

Would recommend to compile through the Makefile, if you're on a linux distro, only after you've installed
gcc, make and libncurses though. The Makefile works with Mingw-w64's make as well, but you will have to remove 
manually the -lncurses linking option.

I will be releasing debs created on Ubuntu 14.04 i386 that will probably also work on almost all debian-based 
distributions(and versions), each time I fix bugs or change something in the UI.

## TODO

* fix stupid bugs like this (DONE)

* implement that horrible piecesOverlap function (DONE)

* fix bug on Windows that rejects input other than the first character after some time (DONE)

* add the functionality for the game to end when a King is unable to make a move without being threatened by another piece/checkmate (WIP)

* fix this bug that only happens with black Pawns (DONE)
