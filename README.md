# ChessLib
## Overview

ChessLib is a chess game implementation in C. It can be used as a library, to simulate a simple chess game with
almost all rules (only en passant and checkmate don't work at the moment). To test out the engine you can run chessgame 
which is a console-based game running on ChessLib. Note that for now it only supports human players and a computer player
which chooses random moves.

The thought process behind this project was for me to implement a chess engine for the first time, without seeing
code from other projects or how implementations of chess engines are generally done.

If you find any bugs or encounter problematic behavior, either do a PR or file a bug report.
If the above methods won't work for you try contacting me on my e-mail.

Note that some features are still at a very early stage of development, such as checkmate.

## How to play

You type the letter of the piece you want to move as you see it on the board and 
the coordinates of the square you want to move to (for example if you want to move Pawn to square 
A3 you type Pa3 or pa3 or PA3 or pA3), and the game will find the piece you want to move
and move it by itself.

The game at the moment doesn't detect checkmate, but it prevents you from making moves that will not unthreaten the King during check.

At the debug version you will see possible moves the King can make when he's threatened, or
when an enemy piece is threatening a square surrounding the King. This is mainly for debugging the check and
checkmate features.

A log file which records all the moves that took place, is created during the game.

With the Linux version if you type 'pieces' or 'PIECES' you will get the Unicode chess characters 
and if you type 'letters' or 'LETTERS' it reverts back to the capital letter representation.

## Building

Needs libncurses to compile on Linux.

If you're compiling on Windows, try using Mingw-w64 to install gcc and dmake (or make). It will probably won't compile as well with MSVC.

To compile and run on Windows with dmake (or make):

    dmake dll & dmake exe & chessgame.exe
    
or if you're using Powershell:

    dmake dll;dmake exe;./chessgame.exe

To compile and run on Linux:

    make && make run

To play against the computer (chooses only random moves for now) run:

    ./build/chessgame-cli -c

I will be releasing precompiled binaries made on Ubuntu 14.04 i386 
and Windows 7 32bit, when bugs are fixed or something in the UI changes.

## TODO

* implement versioning (DONE)

* add functionality for the engine to detect checkmate and end the game (WIP)

* fix this weird bug that only happens with black Pawns (DONE)

* prevent the King from moving to a square that might threaten him (WIP)

* program a functional computer player (WIP)

* split all the command line specific functions (such as printBoard) from the main chess engine and rewrite the Makefile accordingly

* port the main engine to other languages
